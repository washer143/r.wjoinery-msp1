<p> This is a fictional website based on my current job working as a joiner/carpenter. This website will advertise bespoke joinery catered to the customers needs. It will advertise an array of different joinery skills and projects that i have completed in my 13 years as a joiner, showcasing stairs, windows, kitchens, doors and anything that may have been produced by myself.

The website will cater to customers that desire handmade craftsmanship and joinery, that is fulfilled to a high standard and with great care. The website will reflect this through previous customer feedback and photographic evidence.

# Website Design

## Colors 

For my color scheme i've chosen to use grey and black for contrast in the header and footer to give a modern touch, then for the body i chose an off white color to make it easy on the eyes and to give a feeling of warmth and contentment. This is what i would hope the user would sense. Then theres a theme of a dark red and gold color running throughout, for the headers and logo.

 # Features
 
 ## Navigation & Logo
* The navbar and logo feature on all 4 pages, they're fully responsive and the logo acts as an active link to re-direct to the homepage, which i feel is a required function for user experience.
* All four pages, home, about us, services and contact us, as is common with web design are positioned to right, which gives user familiarity.
* All links turn a different color when hovered over to signify activity, and to click. Give easy navigation to users.
* I designed the nav bar to match the footer with the same grey and black color theme to match not only the logo but to also stand out, and make for an easier user experience.

 ## Footer
 * The footer is displayed throughout all pages, with the address of our workshop to the left, opening hours displayed centrally and social media links displayed to the right. 
 * The footer is fully responsive, as the screen becomes smaller any content to the right will wrap underneath, with social media links displayed to the bottom, followed by opening hours and address details stacking on one another.
