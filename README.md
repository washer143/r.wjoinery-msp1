#  R.W JOINERY
# Introduction
<p> This is a fictional website based on my current job working as a joiner/carpenter. This website will advertise bespoke joinery catered to the customers needs. It will advertise an array of different joinery skills and projects that i have completed in my 13 years as a joiner, showcasing stairs, windows, kitchens, doors and anything that may have been produced by myself.

The website will cater to customers that desire handmade craftsmanship and joinery, that is fulfilled to a high standard and with great care. The website will reflect this through previous customer feedback and photographic evidence. Through the information provided this should give the customer a good understanding of the quality of work being provided, and lead them to contact us. </p>

# Website Design

## Structure

The website will be easy to navigate and user friendly, with a recognizable navbar and links to lead them from one page to the other seamlessly. The website will consist of 4 pages, they are as follows:

* Home: This will consist of initial information about what services we can offer.
* About us: This will consist of details of our experience, expertise and our workshop.
* services: This will showcase what we can offer in terms of joinery and design.
* contact us: A contact page to provide guests with information of our location and contact details and a form to submit if they wish to get in contact.

## Colors 

For my color scheme i've chosen to use grey and black for contrast in the header and footer to give a modern touch, then for the body i chose an off white color to make it easy on the eyes and to give a feeling of warmth and contentment. This is what i would hope the user would sense. I chose to use a white padding around every photo to make them stand out, also to give the writing more body. Then theres a theme of a dark red and gold color running throughout, for the headers and logo and certain features, creating a continuous theme throughout, keeping familiarity to the user.

![color-palette](/screenshots/color-palette.png)

## Fonts
 The font used throughout the project are "lato" and "mukta", I chose these fonts as i felt they had a crispness and modern feel to it, to make them stand out. I made sure to have them #000000 black and increased the weight on the font where necessary to give it more projection and readability.

## Wireframes
  balsamiq was used to initiate website design and ideas. you can view all design ideas from mobile, tablet to desktop here. [wireframes](./wireframes/)

## Home page
 * The home page features a hero image with text overlay, a slogan and title explaining what we offer as a business. Giving the user the desired information through text and imagery identifying our USP. 
 
 * Below the hero image we'll show a snippet of our services to intrigue and invite the user to investigate further and navigate throughout the website. 

 * As the user scrolls further they'll be introduced to a section on previous customer reviews, further accentuating a feeling of positivity and comfort in the service that they could be provided.
 
 
 ## About Us
 * Hero image with about us text overlay to identify new page and give user familiarity.
 
 * This page contains two sections. First section will contain information about our experience and skills to provide the user with confidence and assure them of our qualities as a professional craftsman. We will also try and create rapport with the user telling them a story about our workshop and how we built the business.
 
 * The second part of this page we will provide progress bars to give users a visual cue of our abilities as a business and craftsmen.
 
 ## Services
 * hero image with text overlay to keep the same theme running through the website.

 # Existing Features and Testing (UX)
 ## Navigation & Logo
* The navbar and logo feature on all 4 pages, they're fully responsive and the logo acts as an active link to re-direct to the homepage, which i feel is a required function for user experience.
* All four pages, home, about us, services and contact us, as is common with web design are positioned to right, which gives user familiarity.
* All links turn a different color when hovered over to signify activity, and to click. Giving easy navigation to users.
* I designed the nav bar to match the footer with the same grey and black color theme to match the logo, but to also stand out, and make navigation a simple user experience.

 ## Footer
 * As a user i want to be able to identify useful information providing details on opening hours, address and links to social media sites. This content is usually situated on the footer.
 * The footer is displayed throughout all pages, with the address of our workshop to the left, opening hours displayed centrally and social media links displayed to the right, all of which are functional.  
 * The footer is fully responsive, as the screen becomes smaller, any content to the right will wrap underneath, with active social media links displayed to the bottom, followed by opening hours and address details stacking on one another.

## Home 
* As a user i want to be to intuitively navigate throughout the site from the homepage.
* This page shows off a snippet of our services section to entice customers, with customer reviews aligned beneath to give users positive re-enforcement. The services header is also active, just like the navbar, it changes color when hovered over, when clicked they will be re-directed straight to the services page. We also have a beautiful hero image of a man working on a lathe, this image lets users know that they've directed themselves to the right page.

# Testing User Stories
# Validation
* HTML Validator was run explicitly towards the end of project development. All issues that were identified have been fix'd, any changes that were made, i made sure to run it through again to make sure there were no miscellaneous code displaced. This may have been a mistake on my part to not run it through til end of my project, moving on to other projects i'll be sure to have more control and insight to my project by putting my code through from the start of building my project, therefore having more control in the process of building my webpage.

* CSS Validator and jigsaw validator was also run at the end phase of the project luckily finding no issues in my code.

* Lighthouse was run at the end of project development, as with validation, i unfortunately did not use light house to have more version control of my project, instead purely focusing on aesthetic design and trying to implement my vision with coding. Going forward i would make full use of lighthouse and fine tune my website as i go along, using lighthouse as a tool to edit/fix any issues, making for a better performing and more accessible website.

# Responsiveness

I started this project on my laptop, i therefore instinctively produced this project as a laptop version first project, which in hindsight i should have given more thought to, but at the time i felt it would be the best way to implement my ideas and then scale down, not that there is a problem with this option, but as i came to learn in media queries, i ran into a multitude of issues. After painstakingly adding and editing code, i finally got it to respond the way i wanted to, from laptop, tablet to mobile device. However for much larger desktop screens i need to tweak the project, by doing a four grid layout system, so there's enough material to span across the page. This is something to consider for future projects.


 
# Bugs
* when i initially started my project i decided to go with a grid layout as this best suited my design, so i used mainly css grid rather than flexbox to layout my content. i had a torrid time figuring out why my grid wasn't being responsive. Eventually taking the time to read thoroughly through https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ i sourced a snippet of code that could be the solution to my problems. The code i was using before.

* As good as it is for designing page layout, it simply wasn't responsive when reducing the page width.
  <img src="screenshots/code-snippet.png" width=40% height=50%>

* Initially i didn't think this worked either, but after playing around with minmax width and changing my fraction to 3 instead of 1, it finally started to click into place.

  <img src="screenshots/code-snippet-2.png" width=60% height=50%>

* The testimonials section was not correctly aligned with the services section home page.

  <img src="screenshots/not-aligned.png" width=70% height=50%>

* Originally i used flexbox to display it as a row, i fixed this by turning it into a grid in css.

   <img src="screenshots/now-evenly-aligned.png" width=80% height=50%>
 
   <img src="screenshots/aligncode.png" width=70% height=50%>
 
   <img src="screenshots/aligncode2.png" width=50% height=50%>

* Images were not rendering to full capacity when the viewport width got bigger leaving white space with their cells, to fix this i added a 100% width targeting images in media query, to be fully responsive.

  <img src="screenshots/whitespace.png" width=75% height=50%>
  
  <img src="screenshots/result.png" width=75% height=50%>

* The navbar menu when viewed on small screens would fall in to two rows with the logo situated above. To fix this i targeted 
nav list elements in media query to reduce padding and font size to give them enough space to align in a row correctly.

  <img src="screenshots/navbar-2.png" width=25% height=50%>
  
  <img src="screenshots/navbar-result.png" width=25% height=50%>


* When viewing the webpages on medium to small tablet devices, i encountered issues with there being not enough real estate for two pictures to align next to each other, to fix this in media query i reduced padding to zero and gave a background color of white. This fix'd the issue quite nicely and gives the images enough space to sit next to each other.

# Unfixed Bugs
There are still some bugs that still need to be addressed unfortunately, i wasn't able to find a solution, hopefully through more knowledge and understanding i can tackle these in the future. They are as follows.

* The navbar on very small screens still folds onto another line, with contact us folding beneath the home button. I would like to work around this by using a a burger menu, i will address this when i have gained the skills necessary to build one.

* The footer is responsive but theres a certain viewport width where the social media links start to disappear, and then when small enough, it will fold beneath inline with opening hours and the address, this lag was concerning to me but i could not find a solution that was any better than what i produced.

* There is slight misalignment issues with the address logo on the contact page. When reduced to a very small screen it appears off centre, i tried to address this in media queries using margin to centre it as much as possible, when getting reduced down. This was the the best solution i could find to the issue.

## Takeaway
This project was a steep learning curve, but through the struggle comes a better understanding of how it all works. Ive taken away a much deeper understanding of the process and how to carefully curate your project. I've gained far more knowledge of how CSS Grid and Flexbox work and look forward to building my skills with these styles, utilizing google chrome developer tools was a great way to navigate your way through hard challenges and to understand what functions work, and how you are affecting them with your code.

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank my mentor Mitko Bacharov for guiding me in the right direction, and pointing out all the bugs that i needed fixing. The online tutor team were also of great support in helping me de-bug some issues.

I'd like to thank my brother-in law who owns bay-joinery which gave me my main source of inspiration, and whom ive had the pleasure of working with over the last few years in the trade.

I'd also like to thank my long suffering partner for her support, and patience.
