#  R.W Joinery
# Introduction
<p> This is a fictional website based on my current job working as a joiner/carpenter. This website will advertise bespoke joinery catered to the customers needs. It will advertise an array of different joinery skills and projects that i have completed in my 13 years as a joiner, showcasing stairs, windows, kitchens, doors and anything that may have been produced by myself.

The website will cater to customers that desire handmade craftsmanship and joinery, that is fulfilled to a high standard and with great care. The website will reflect this through previous customer feedback and photographic evidence. Through the information provided this should give the customer a good understanding of the quality of work being provided, and lead them to contact us and get a quote. </p>

## Colors & Fonts

For my color scheme i've chosen to use grey and black for  for quite obvious reasons as this website is based on a wood working shop, but also because it gives off a feeling of warmth and contentment. This is what i would hope the user would sense. I also used this color scheme to make the website easy on the eyes and to give it an organic natural feel.
