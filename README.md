<p> This is a fictional website based on my current job working as a joiner/carpenter. This website will advertise bespoke joinery catered to the customers needs. It will advertise an array of different joinery skills and projects that i have completed in my 13 years as a joiner, showcasing stairs, windows, kitchens, doors and anything that may have been produced by myself.

The website will cater to customers that desire handmade craftsmanship and joinery, that is fulfilled to a high standard and with great care. The website will reflect this through previous customer feedback and photographic evidence.

# Website Design

## Structure

The website will be easy to navigate and user friendly, with a recognizable navbar and links to lead them from one page to the other seamlessly. The website will consist of 4 pages, they are as follows:

* Home: This will consist of initial information about what services we can offer.
* About us: This will consist of details of our experience, expertise and our workshop.
* services: This will showcase what we can offer in terms of joinery and design.
* contact us: A contact page to provide guests with information of our location and contact details and a form to submit if they wish to get in contact.

## Colors 

For my color scheme i've chosen to use grey and black for contrast in the header and footer to give a modern touch, then for the body i chose an off white color to make it easy on the eyes and to give a feeling of warmth and contentment. This is what i would hope the user would sense. I chose to use a white padding around every photo to make them stand out, also to give the writing more body. Then theres a theme of a dark red and gold color running throughout, for the headers and logo and certain features, creating a continuous theme throughout, keeping familiarity to the user.

## Fonts
 The font used throughout the project are "lato" and "mukta", I chose these fonts as i felt they had a crispness and modern feel to it, to make them stand out. I made sure to have them #000000 black and increased the weight on the font where necessary to give it more projection and readability.

 ## Navigation & Logo
* The navbar and logo feature on all 4 pages, they're fully responsive and the logo acts as an active link to re-direct to the homepage, which i feel is a required function for user experience.
* All four pages, home, about us, services and contact us, as is common with web design are positioned to right, which gives user familiarity.
* All links turn a different color when hovered over to signify activity, and to click. Give easy navigation to users.
* I designed the nav bar to match the footer with the same grey and black color theme to match not only the logo but to also stand out, and make for an easier user experience.

 ## Footer

 * The footer is fully responsive, as the screen becomes smaller any content to the right will wrap underneath, with social media links displayed to the bottom, followed by opening hours and address details stacking on one another.

# Validation
* HTML Validator was run explicitly towards the end of project development. All issues that were identified have been fix'd, any changes that were made, i made sure to run it through again to make sure there were no miscellaneous code displaced. This may have been a mistake on my part to not run it through til end of my project, moving on to other projects i'll be sure to have more control and insight to my project by putting my code through from the start of building my project, therefore having more control in the process of building my webpage.

* CSS Validator and jigsaw validator was also run at the end phase of the project luckily finding no issues in my code.

* Lighthouse was run at the end of project development, as with validation, i unfortunately did not use light house to have more version control of my project, instead purely focusing on aesthetic design and trying to implement my vision with coding. Going forward i would make full use of lighthouse and fine tune my website according to lighthouse scores.
