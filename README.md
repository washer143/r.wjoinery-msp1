It will advertise an array of different joinery skills and projects that i have completed in my 13 years as a joiner, showcasing stairs, windows, kitchens, doors and anything that may have been produced by myself.

The website will cater to customers that desire handmade craftsmanship and joinery, that is fulfilled to a high standard and with great care. The website will reflect this through previous customer feedback and photographic evidence.

# Website Design

## Structure

## Colors 

For my color scheme i've chosen to use grey and black for contrast in the header and footer to give a modern touch, then for the body i chose an off white color to make it easy on the eyes and to give a feeling of warmth and contentment. This is what i would hope the user would sense. I chose to use a white padding around every photo to make them stand out, also to give the writing more body. Then theres a theme of a dark red and gold color running throughout, for the headers and logo and certain features, creating a continuous theme throughout, keeping familiarity to the user.

## Fonts
 The font used throughout the project are "lato" and "mukta", I chose these fonts as i felt they had a crispness and modern feel to it, to make them stand out. I made sure to have them #000000 black and increased the weight on the font where necessary to give it more projection and readability.

## Wireframes

 # Existing Features and Testing (UX)
 ## Navigation & Logo
* The navbar and logo feature on all 4 pages, they're fully responsive and the logo acts as an active link to re-direct to the homepage, which i feel is a required function for user experience.
* All four pages, home, about us, services and contact us, as is common with web design are positioned to right, which gives user familiarity.
* All links turn a different color when hovered over to signify activity, and to click. Giving easy navigation to users.
* I designed the nav bar to match the footer with the same grey and black color theme to match the logo, but to also stand out, and make navigation a simple user experience.

 ## Footer
 * The footer is displayed throughout all pages, with the address of our workshop to the left, opening hours displayed centrally and social media links displayed to the right.  
 * The footer is fully responsive, as the screen becomes smaller any content to the right will wrap underneath, with active social media links displayed to the bottom, followed by opening hours and address details stacking on one another.

# Testing User Stories
# Validation
* HTML Validator was run explicitly towards the end of project development. All issues that were identified have been fix'd, any changes that were made, i made sure to run it through again to make sure there were no miscellaneous code displaced. This may have been a mistake on my part to not run it through til end of my project, moving on to other projects i'll be sure to have more control and insight to my project by putting my code through from the start of building my project, therefore having more control in the process of building my webpage.

* CSS Validator and jigsaw validator was also run at the end phase of the project luckily finding no issues in my code.

* Lighthouse was run at the end of project development, as with validation, i unfortunately did not use light house to have more version control of my project, instead purely focusing on aesthetic design and trying to implement my vision with coding. Going forward i would make full use of lighthouse and fine tune my website as i go along, using lighthouse as a tool to edit/fix any issues, making for a better performing and more accessible website.

# Browser Compatibility
The website was tested on the following browsers:
* Google Chrome
* Safari
* Mozilla Firefox

They all appeared as they should.

The website was deployed using github, these are the steps i followed.
* Login to github.
* click on settings tab placed above the green code button.
* On the left scroll to find "Pages" which will open up a new section.
* Go to source and select master branch.
* Once master branch has been selected, the page will give you a link indicating a successful deployment.

If you wish to clone the repository these are the steps to take:
* Go to github repository.
* Go to the code button located next to the gitpod button and click.
* Select if you want to clone with https, SSH or Github CLI. 
* Click button beside url to copy to clipboard
* Open with github desktop, and follow the prompts to complete the clone. 
* Alternatively you can open Git Bash and change the current working directory, to where you want a cloned directory.
* Type git clone in the terminal, paste the URL you copied earlier, and press “enter” to create your local clone.

If you want to fork the repository you can click the fork button located towards the top right of the page.

# Responsiveness
i started this project on my laptop, i therefore instinctively produced this project as a laptop version first project, which in hindsight i should have given more thought to, but at the time i felt it would be the best way to implement my ideas and then scale down, not that there is a problem with this option, but as i came to learn in media queries, i ran into a multitude of issues. After painstakingly adding and editing code, i finally got it to respond the way i wanted to, from laptop, tablet to mobile device. However for much larger desktop screens i need to tweak the project, by doing a four grid layout system, so there's enough material to span across the page. This is something to consider for future projects.
